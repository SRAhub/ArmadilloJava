ArmadilloJava
==================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SebastianNiemann/ArmadilloJava.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SebastianNiemann/ArmadilloJava)

Provides pure Java based interfaces that are similar to the [Armadillo C++ Algebra Library (Armadillo)](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) by Conrad Sanderson et al., based on Peter Abeles' [Efficient Java Matrix Library (EJML)](http://efficient-java-matrix-library.googlecode.com) Version 0.23 from 21.06.2013.

If not stated otherwise (marked as non-canonical), the provided interfaces should be identical to Armadillo (e.g. same ordering of arguments, accepted values, ...). However, this project is based on EJML to provide a pure Java solution, which is why numeric results may slightly differ from the Armadillo C++ Algebra Library.
